# scripts/

## Status
- Phase1: reference only (not guaranteed portable)
- Execution environment: local only for now

## Notes
- Some scripts contain absolute paths (e.g. C:\work\boatrace\).
- Do NOT assume portability.
- Do NOT refactor paths unless phase2 is approved.

## Phase2 (planned, optional)
- Introduce BASE_DIR / CLI args
- Make scripts worldline-safe for cloud/multi-PC execution
